# 🧪 Fun Code Experiments 🎨✨

Welcome to my little **lab of code curiosities**!  
This repo is where I stash random experiments in **Python** and **JavaScript** — snippets I find online, tweak, and play around with just for fun.

## 📂 Current Experiments
- 🎆 `new_year_1.py` – A festive Python snippet to kick off the new year.
- 🎇 `new_year_2.py` – Another variation, because one celebration is never enough!

(More experiments may appear here whenever curiosity strikes 🌀)

## 🚀 How to Play
Run any file directly — no setup, no fuss:

```bash
# Python magic
python new_year_1.py

# JavaScript sparks
node some_experiment.js
